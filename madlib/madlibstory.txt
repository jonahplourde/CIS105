One day, a sparkly dragon decided to soar 
in the magical land of Enchanted Forest. 

The dragon was feeling amazed, so they decided to 
seek help from their best friend, a talking phoenix. 

Together, they journeyed through forests, crossed rivers, and eventually 
ran into the famous Taylor Swift, who was also looking for a 
mysterious crystal.

"I will help you find it!" said the Taylor Swift, striking a heroic pose.

The three friends spent the whole day searching, laughing, and causing 
mayhem wherever they went. Finally, they discovered the crystal 
hidden behind a giant sparkly rock.

With their quest complete, the dragon, the phoenix, 
and Taylor Swift became the best of friends forever, and they 
all lived happily ever after in Enchanted Forest.

                            THE END
